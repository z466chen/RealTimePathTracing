1. Compilation:
    1.1 Instruction: 
        1.1.1 modify macros in file "defines.hpp"
        1.1.2 premake4 gmake
        1.1.3 make
        1.1.4 ./A3 <target-file>
        you should see a interactive window after previous instructions with the target lua file object

        Toggle of ANTI_ALIASING when generating anti-aliased images, result should be located the result/{method}_{img_name}.png
    1.2 Additional Assumptions

    1.3 Lab Computer
        None

2. Manual
    Extra features implemented:
        1. Mirror reflections
        2. Refraction
        3. Supersampling
            3.1 grid
            3.2 jitter
            3.3 random
            3.4 rotated_grids
            3.5 quincunx
            3.6 low_discrepancy sequence (harmmersley)
                Uses Harmmersley low discrepancy sequence generator for quasi monte-carlo sampling.

        4. additional primitives
            4.1 rounded_box: gr.rounded_box
            4.2 cylinder: gr.cylinder
            4.3 torus: gr.torus
        5. Texture mapping
            5.1 solid mapping using non-improved Perlin noise
                https://mrl.cs.nyu.edu/~perlin/doc/oscar.html
            gr.solid in lua file
        6. CSG
            gr.csg in lua file
            Used sdf and raymarching techniques for implementing this part,
            handles union, difference, intersection, and smooth blending

Really sorry for not having a very creative scene, I did not have enough time.
